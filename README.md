# Adil Keku Gazder (@ag826)

As a Data Science graduate student at Duke University (Class of '26), I am passionate about bringing multidisciplinary perspectives and data-driven approaches to solving today‚Äôs biggest challenges and creating impactful solutions from the ground up. My diverse experiences span various domains, including recent work in Healthcare focusing on Oncology analytics (Lung Cancer and DLBCL), following a successful stint in the Logistics industry where I specialized in Growth Strategy and Diversification. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and love understanding how we can apply advanced computing techniques, theories, and algorithms in our everyday lives.

I completed my Bachelor's degree from Shiv Nadar University in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Materials Sciences (focusing on Nanostructured Functionalized Surfaces) and a minor from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Beyond academics and professional work, I'm also a Podcast Host, an Emcee, an Investor, a Researcher, and a two-time All-India level Double Gold Medalist in Taekwondo.
